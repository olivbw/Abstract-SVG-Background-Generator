# Abstract SVG Background Generator
This Python script generates an abstract SVG background by randomly placing points and drawing lines between them based on a distance threshold. It is also adding additional particles for texture. 

The generated SVG file is saved as `abstract_background.svg`

The original background idea was taken from this [source](https://www.heroscreen.cc/2023/01/abstract-mesh-white-background-wallpaper-4k-and-8k-for-pc.html). 

## Running the Script
 - Ensure svgwrite is installed, and if not, download it using `pip install svgwrite`.
 - Run the script using Python: `python abstract_background_generator.py`
 - The script will output SVG background generated upon completion, and the SVG file `abstract_background.svg` will be created in the current directory.
